// Using what you have just learned about state in React, you are going to create a <DiceBox /> component that renders 5 dice numbers for the user to view.

// You Must
// Create a class component called <DiceBox />
// Write a method in that class that produces 5 random numbers between 1 and 6 and saves them in state.
// Display the 5 random numbers in your <DiceBox /> JSX.
// Provide a button the user can click on that will redo step 2 and present the new numbers to the user.
